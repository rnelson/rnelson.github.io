## Blog

I keep starting blogs, but instead of adding new technical posts when I come up 
with one, I inevitably start filling them with personal posts to keep the site
active. A year or so later, I get tired of having so few technical posts and 
kill the blog.

Instead of doing that, I am going to keep this one technical. If no new posts
are added in a couple of years, so be it.

## Me

### whoami

My name is Ross Nelson. I'm a developer living in Omaha, NE, USA. I dabble in a 
bit of everything, from operating system development to modern web development.

### Career

[My day job](http://hobbytown.com) involves working with both Visual Basic 6 
and the modern .NET stack. My most recent previous jobs were doing web 
development in PHP and Java.

### Organizations

I am currently the Delivery Lead (technical overseer of all projects) for our 
local [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) brigade, 
[Open Nebraska](http://opennebraska.io).

During Hack Omaha III, put on in part by Open Nebraska, I worked with my friend 
[Dustin Lipskey](http://lipskey.me) on a project using food inspection data 
for the entire state.

We're currently working on [a new version](http://foodinspections.org) in our 
spare time, but for now you can view 
[our prototype](http://foodinspections.opennebraska.io).
